<h1 align = "center">Hi I'm RonaldðŸ˜„</h1>

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- [House-of-Iot](https://github.com/House-of-IoT) - a collection of custom smart device automation software with advanced features out of the box.
- [Collaborative-IoT](https://github.com/Collaborative-IoT) - a platform for collectively controlling IoT devices/systems with a group of peers that supports real time voice and text communication.

ðŸš€ I'm currently learning WASM and Web3.0 based authentication.
ðŸš€ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on great software and improve open source IoT!
